# hello-world
My first repository 
Hello World! This is me, committing to the world of development! I have lived in the technology world for six plus years doing QA on development teams for SaaS, eCommerce, and for a digital agency doing various projects. QA helped me find this world..a world I was not introduced to or familiar with growing up. I felt I was too late to the party and suffered from some severe imposter syndrome. No more! I am taking my stand, and having fun learning the ways of the coding universe!
